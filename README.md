# ESP32 Color Music

Bluetooth audio receiver, with audio playback via i2s DAC equipped with the 
functionality of light music and light modes for addressable LED strips.

Audio is obtained in high quality, and the quality of the analog signal of the reproduced 
sound depends only on the i2s DAC. At the heart of receiving and playing music is the 
[ESP32-A2DP library](https://github.com/pschatzmann/ESP32-A2DP). All details on sound quality should be found in its repository].

The display of color modes is carried out on addressable LED strips like ws2818b. 
This LED strip software uses the [FastLED library](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED).
